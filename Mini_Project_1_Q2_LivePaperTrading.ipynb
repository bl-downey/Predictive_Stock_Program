Take one of your best strategies from Question 1 and run it for 7-10 days (run it live) on the 5 stocks you picked. You can use the buy/sell order methods mentioned in starter code as an example to place orders for live paper trading. So your algorithm is automatically trading live but only on paper. Make sure, the settings for your algorithm enable you to buy and sell within the week (i.e. set your profit margin lower for sell).
